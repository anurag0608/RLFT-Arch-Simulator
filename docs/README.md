# RLFT-Arch-Simulator

## Description

RLFT-Arch-Simulator is a simulation of an architecture for a rate-limited fault-tolerant server implemented in GoLang. Please note that this project does not represent a real server, nor does it send or process requests like an actual server. Instead, it provides a simulated environment for exploring and understanding the architectural concepts involved in building a rate-limited fault-tolerant server.

## Introduction

The RLFT-Arch-Simulator project aims to demonstrate the principles of building a rate-limited fault-tolerant server using GoLang. While it does not function as a production server, it serves as a valuable educational tool for those interested in understanding the underlying architecture of such systems.
